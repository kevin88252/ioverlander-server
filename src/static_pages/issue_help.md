# Issue Help

There is a button on the website and phone apps which says "Report a Problem". Whenever someone uses that button, it creates an issue.

Open issues:    
Closed issues:   

Issues are different than tasks! Tasks are automatically generated, issues are knowingly created by users. To read more about tasks see this page:

We use issues to track who is pushing the RAP button and why. There are 5 different types of problems people can report.

* Place is Closed
* Place is in the Wrong Location
* Place is a Duplicate
* Place detail/amenities are Incorrect
* Other- send a comment

Some of these are also problems users could fix themselves by checking in, but many users don't understand how a check-in works, so we've added it here. For example, many people email us and ask "how do I mark a place closed?" This is something you can do with a check-in, but it also can be done by clicking the report a problem button.

With some types of problems reported, we actually create BOTH and issue and a task. The issue is just for tracking purposes; the task is where you actually approve/reject the changes. It looks exactly like your usual tasks, but near the top will be a new table that says LINKED ISSUES, and that will have a link to the issue that was also created. If you close the task, the issue will **automatically be closed**! If there is NO TASK then you must go into the issue and close it manually.

To see all the issues that are open:    
Tasks show up in the normal tasks list with everything else: 

 When you click the Report a problem button you get these options:

![][1]

## PLACE CLOSED:

If you click the first option "This place is closed or doesn't exist" you get three more options:

![][2]

### First option: This place is permanently closed.

If a place is permanently closed, the place is marked closed. A checkin is automatically created that says "This place is permanently closed" A place correction task is created so it can be double checked by the moderator. And issue is created just to let us know a user reported this with the RAP button. Issue is auto-closed when task is closed.

### Second option: I tried to visit this place but couldn't find it.

If someone couldn't find the place, it's also marked closed. A checkin is automatically created that says: "I wasn't able to find this place". A place correction task and issue are auto created. (Same as above)

### Third option: Other (leave comment):

With this option the place is marked closed. A checkin is made automatically at it contains whatever the user comment was. A place correction task and issue are created. (Same as above)

## THIS PLACE IS IN THE WRONG LOCATION:

If you click this, you get this screen, again 3 options on this (Although less obvious)   
![][3]

### First option: I have the coordinates of the correct location

Someone knows the new location. This automatically corrects the location. Creates a checkin from the User that says "This place is in wrong location â€“ it is located at 0.00000, 0.00000" (only 0.0000 is replaced by the actualy coordinates). This creates a place correction task so moderators can double check. Also creates an issue. Issue is auto-closed when task is closed. NOTE: On the phone apps, this option can pull GPS coordinates from the user's device, or they can enter them manually.

### Second option: Unable to find the place, mark it closed

This is just a link that redirects the user to the previous, THIS PLACE IS CLOSED screens.

### Third option: Correct coordinates were not recorded.

If someone knows the location is wrong, but didn't record the coordinates. This just creates a checkin with the User's comments. It does NOT create a task. Creates an issue that we'll have to go read and decide if the place should be closed or deleted or ignored until another user visits it. This issue must be manually closed.

## DUPLICATES

This allows users to pick a place that is a duplicate.

![][4]  
This creates a duplicate** task** that has the linked issue at the top (this is how you know its user generated not auto-generated). We'll have to pay close attention to these tasks, since they are coming from users they are likely to be valid. An issue is also created, but will be closed when you close the task (same as all the others.)

## THE DETAILS, DESCRIPTION AND AMENITIES ARE WRONG:

Looks like this:  
![][5]  
Again, this is one of those for people who can't figure out how check-ins work! It just redirects to the check-in screen. No issues are created. Tasks are created for place corrections, as per the usual check-in process.

## SOMETHING ELSE:

This is a way for users to send us comments about a place AND have it attached their username, a date, a link to the place in question, and their comments. This ONLY creates an issue that must be reviewed and manually fixed and closed. This is a way for us to control all the silly emails we get that don't have 1/10th of the info we need to fix the problem. Also, it allows us to have other moderators (like you!) help troubleshoot some of these problems. It does NOT create a check-in, it only creates the issue.

When an issue is reported, it shows up on the website at the top of the place description. This makes it easier for us to see what is going on and is good feedback for the user that we did actually get the issue and are working on it. Looks like this for a place I've been testing:
