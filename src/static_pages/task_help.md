**Task: **This is the type of task. Common tasks are: Eliminate duplicates, Place corrections and Sanitize Descriptions. Pay attention to what the task type is! Click on the task type to start the task.

**User: **That's you. If it's not, there is a problem. Email us.

**Priority: **Tasks are sorted by priority. The bigger the number, the more important the task. Do the tasks at the top of your list first.

**Status: **Normally this field will only say "assigned". When a task is completed, this status changes, but this task is also automatically removed from your list. You will likely only see the status say "assigned".

**Description: **The description lists the names of the places involved in your task. If you are sanitizing descriptions, you will only see one place name. If you are merging duplicates you will see the name of both places.

**Edit button: **This allows you to edit the task. You can manually change the priority or the task type. Note: you shouldn't need to touch this!

**Destroy: **This will completely remove a task from existence. Do NOT click this button. If for some reason a task cannot be completed, tell us why. There are very few instances when a task needs to be destroyed.

The most common task is to sanitize place descriptions. The name is a little misleading, you'll need to look at a lot more than just the description. These task were created for all places that were inputted by spreadsheets from previous travelers. Some travelers have excellent data, and there tasks will be fast. Some travelers had only a small amount of data, or it was in a format that could not easily be displayed on a spreadsheet. Tasks for these places will take more time.

You have two main goals when sanitizing a place:

1\. Make sure the description is factual and not an opinion.  
2\. Make sure as many of the amenity fields are filled out as possible (based on the description).

##  Step-by-step example:

### 1\. Click the name of the task in your list:

![sanitize-step-1][3]

### 2\. Check that the name of the place is short and sweet.

Remove and additional numbers or description notes. Delete things like, "free", "nice", "ok", or any strange numbers. Basic names like "wild camp" or "roadside" are fine. If it's not an established place, it will not have a name.

### 3\. Do NOT touch the date verified.

This is the date the traveler visited this place. It is not a date for when the data was reviewed.

### 4\. Clean up the description.

Read the description and remove any parts of it that are opinions, or relevant only to that travelers stay. Keep anything that describes the location. Do NOT add anything. It is very important not to guess. If you are unsure, leave it.

These descriptions are copied in the reviews section of the place. The idea is that the description includes the facts about the place. The reviews are meant to have the personal information from the traveler. If you delete from the description, it will remain in the comments section. Here is an example of a place with a description and several reviews:

**Keep in the description:**

* Things that tell you what is and isn't there. i.e. This place has a big grassy area for tents, there is wifi, hot showers, bathrooms, grill areas, etc. There is no running water, no access to the beach, etc.
* Descriptions of the area or the amenities: Hot showers! Stunning scenery, best food in Chile, etc.
* Location information or directions: Close to town, easy access to bus stop, go left after the bridge, only 5 minutes from the border, etc.
* Prices. Do not change currencies.
* Information (even if the seem opinionated) that would be relevant to other travelers: Loud music from disco played all night, owner is a jerk and doesn't allow pets, etc.

**Remove from descriptions:**

* Travelers opinions that are vague and do not add value: i.e. Had a terrible time. I liked it here. My favorite place!
* Travelers experiences not related to the place: i.e. I was sick here. We met Bob in this campground.

It may be difficult to decide which opinions are informational, and which are irrelevant rants. Ask yourself "is this something that is likely to change from traveler to traveler". If your answer is yes, delete it.

**For example, the following edits were made in this description:** _Our favorite place on the Carretera! Highly recommended. Huge grassy camping area run by a friendly family. They sell fresh veggies, some of the only ones you'll find on this road out of season. There is a nice kitchen with wood-fired oven and stove and a big sink area. There is a second covered fogon with a fireplace and sink. It's on a small river (with fish!) and five minutes walk from the huge Rio Baker. Stunning scenery, mountains, rivers, and fields. I'd move here in a heartbeat. You can also buy a "Patagonia Chileana Sin Represas" sticker here. The owner told us if the dams go through as planned the entire property will be 20 meters under water. Sad._

### 5\. Fill in the amenities.

Beneath the description are a whole bunch of amenities. Read the description and if it mentions one of the amenities, select it from the drop down. For example, if the description says: Electricity / wifi / hot showers. You'd select "Yes" from Electicity, "Wifi â€“ speed unknown" from Internet, and "Hot" from Showers.  If an amenity is not mentioned, do NOT select "no", just leave it as "unknown".

### 6\. Click Update Place.

You'll be taken to a preview of what you edited.

### 7\. Double check your entries.

If you realize you have made a mistake click "Re-open Task" and make your changes. If you are ok with everything, click "My Tasks" to be taken back to your lists of tasks.

When you eliminate duplicates, you also will need to sanitize the description and fill out the amenities. Make sure you read the above steps. When a duplicate task is completed, any sanitize description tasks related to the two places being merged are automatically closed. So please make sure to check the name, description and amenities are correct before you merge the duplicates.

## Steps:

### 1\. Click the name of the task "Eliminate Duplicates"

### 2\. Determine if the places are in fact duplicates.

Consider:

* Are the names the same?
* Are the types (category) the same? Do NOT merge a hotel with a campground. Even if the campground is part of the hotel, we keep them separate in iOverlander.
* Are they close together? (The distance apart is listed right under the GPS cordinates).
* If they are not close together, is it because it could be a big camping area? Or is this a city where it is unlikely to be a big space?

If they are not duplicates, STOP. Go to the bottom of the page and click "Not duplicates". Do not sanitize the descriptions, do not enter any additional information.

If they are duplicates, go to step 3. If you are unsure, do NOT complete the task. Email us for a second opinion.

### 3\. Pick the best name.

The merger automatically selects the name and description from place A. But this is not always the best, or the most accurate. Remember to sanitize the name while you are at it. If they have different names, but you aren't sure which is correct, double check they are duplicates. If so, enter both names with a dash between them.

### 4\. Do NOT touch date verified.

This is automatically set to pull the most recent date between the two places.

### 5\. Pick the best description, or merge the two descriptions. And sanitize it!

This is a combo task, you want to keep the best description, but add any info that may be missing from the second description. And do the normal sanitizing task as well. If the descriptions are contradictory, use the information with the place that has the most recent date verified.

### 6\. Fill out the amenities.

Reading the description, make sure the amenities fields are all filled out. Is something mentioned in one of the descriptions that is marked "unknown"? If so, select the right option. If the two places have contradicting amenity information, the merger will automatically select the information from the most recent place. Unless the most recent visited does not have an entry for that amenity.

Read the descriptions and check that the merger hasn't missed anything.

### 7\. Click Merge.

### 8\. Review your merging information.

If you need to make edits, click "Re-Open this task". If you are satisfied, click "My Open Tasks" to return to your task list.



Everytime a user checks-in to a location they first have an opportunity to leave a comment, and second they are asked to verify all of the information about the place is correct. Travelers can change GPS coordinates, names, descriptions, amenities, etc. When a user makes changes to a place a "Place corrections" task is created. This is simply a double check process to make sure someone isn't maliciously closing or marking places incorrectly.

Steps:

### 1\. Click the name of the task "Place Corrections"

### 2\. Read through the changed information.

Look for anything that looks wrong. Is this information from a current overlanders? Is the word "Test" used anywhere? Are there multiple corrections for places that are nowhere near each other? Does the new description contain bad language? Use your judgement here.

### 3\. If the corrects are legitimate, click the "Apply Corrections" button. If the corrections are from a test, or are malicious, click the "Discard corrections" button.
