# Record your Data

If you are currently on the road there are several ways to record your places in hopes of adding them to our database.

## 1\. Get our iPhone app!

The iOverlander iPhone app is the perfect companion. It will allow you to add places and photos and update our database, even when your phone is offline! You can also use the app to search for places near you. [Learn more about it][1].

## 2\. Add places online

Use the friendly online web app to add and update our database. You can "check-in" to leave comments and update existing places. Or you can add a new locations if it isn't currently in our system. To add a place, or leave a review and make corrections to an existing place, visit our [New Check-In page][2].

## 3\. Record on a spreadsheet and bulk upload later

If you want to record your info, but don't have an iPhone, or want to use our online app, than use our spreadsheet. We've created a template, complete with data validation that you can use if you'd like to get started quickly. We personally use Google Spreadsheets, but you will be fine using Excel or Numbers. If you are using something other than these programs, just make sure that it can export spread sheets in the CSV format, and you'll be fine.&nbsp;[Click here to open the template][3].&nbsp;You can read more info about what info we need in each column on our [preferred inputs page][4].
