# About iOverlander

iOverlander is a mapping project started by overlanders Sam Chrsitansen of [Song of the Road][1] and Jessica Mans of [Life Remotely][2]. It began with the simple desire to combine may of the currently overlander accommodation listings on the web. Of course, one thing turned into another, an iPhone app was born, and so was this website. We'll be confined to spreadsheet no longer! This projects contributors number many more than just the founders. [Many travelers][3] have dedicated their time, ideas and most importantly their GPS coordinates. Thanks to all of you!

## iOverlander's mission

To create a database of places that is easy to access, update and improve. For overlanders, by overlanders.

## Our process

How did we get here? Well, a lot of very long email chains. But we did have a plan from the beginning, this is how we started:

* Take existing overlander accommodation listings from the web and combine into one standard format.
* Make a browse-able online database that current overlanders can use to find places.
* Create a simple way to update and add reviews to each place.
* Encourage overlanders to track their trip, and add places and update exisiting information.

## What's important?

When creating a site like this, there are many things to consider. But every detail doesn't mean a thing unless you know what is important to your project. These things are important to us. Of course this list isn't complete, but these are standards we constantly remind ourselves of.

* This site and app remain free to all users.
* The data is of the highest quality.
* The functionality is friendly for overlanders. It can be used and accessed in multiple ways and in multiple formats.

## We're not done yet!

iOverlander is a work in progress. It's volunteer run by people who are usually living out of their vehicle in many parts of the world. It moves slowly, but with great intentions. See our list of [what's coming][4] to know what we are currently working on implementing. If you have an idea that's not already on our list, [send us an email][5], or better yet offer to [help out][6]!
