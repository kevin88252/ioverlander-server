# FAQs

### I just added a place, but it's not showing up on the map. What gives?

All new places added on the website may take up to 24 hours to show up on the map. New places added via the mobile app may take up to 7 days to appear on the app, although they will appear on the website with 24 hours. To increase the speed of the site, the points on the map are only cached once per day. If you added a place with the iPhone app, make sure that your phone has synchronized the data. Go to Settings, then Synchronize, then look at the bottom of the screen under My Data. The status should say "completely synchronized." However, even if your phone is synchronized, it may not appear on your app for up to a week. The mobile app database is only regenerated once per week. 

### I noticed mistakes in some places, how do I submit corrections?

In order to make edits to a place, you will need to check-in. After submitting your check-in (a comment and date you visited), you'll be prompted to make edits to the listing. Because we want to make sure your information is the most up-to-date, you can only make edits if you were the most recent visitor to the place. Each individual page listing contains a link to check-in. Or you can go through the process of [creating a new check-in][1]. You can also check-in from the iPhone app. Note: You will need to register for the site before you can check-in.

### I know of a place that isn't listed on your site. How do I add it?

1.  Go to the [Check-in or Add New Place][2] page.
2. Enter the GPS coordinates at the top of the page, or navigate to it on the map. Click the big "Add New Place" button.
3. Enter all the details and submit.

### How do I mark a place as closed or non-existent?

Locate the place [on the map][2]. Click the "Check-in" link. In the comments of the check-in leave a note as to why the place is closed, and if it permanent or temporary (if you know). Submit the check-in. On the next screen you are asked to make corrections to the listing. Change the field OPEN: to NO. If you don't change this field the place will not be marked closed!

### How do I download all of the places in a GPX or CSV format?

There are two ways to download points:  
1\. Download the points by country [on this page][3]   
2\. Do a search on [this page][4]:  After the search is complete, at the top of the page, underneath the header "### Places Found" it says "Download these results as GPX | JSON | CSV | XLS." Click one of the links to download you search results.

### What do all of the icons on the map mean?

On the top right corner of the homepage there is a button that says "Show Legend." Click the button and then select an icon on the left to view the category description on the right side.

### How do I download OpenStreetMaps?

The easiest way to download OSM is to go to the site: [http://garmin.openstreetmap.nl/][5]
There is a great step-by-step tutorial here: [http://songoftheroad.com/2013/10/gps-mapping/][6]

There are other open source maps available online, depending where you are traveling they may be better than OSM. Here is a list of maps for the Pan-American: [The best FREE GPS maps for Central and South America][7]

### Is iOverlander a corporation? Are you going to sell my data or start charging me to use the site?

iOverlander is a nonprofit, meaning any money we earn or that is donated goes to paying for the costs of hosting and maintaining the site. We intend to keep it free for overlanders forever, although expect us to eventually ask for donations, because it's not free to host website and list iPhone apps. But no, we aren't in this to make money, especially off overlanders! We do not intend to sell any of the data, but we do request ownership of it so that we can share it. For example, we're going to give all of these POI to other mapping companies like Cenrut and OSM, so all the points will already be on your GPS maps, but in order to do that we must have the rights to the user submitted data. Here are the [Terms & Conditions of Use][8].
