# Bulk Import

Do you have an existing list of places you'd like to add to iOverlander? Great! We want them. At the moment, you can't bulk upload places yourself. (We're working on it!). However you can help us get the data ready so it's easy for us to add.

### First, make sure you've checked these things:

1. Do you have permission to use this data? If it's yours, then great! If not, please contact the owner of the place listings to make sure we have permission to add them to our database.
2. Does this data have the required fields? (Or can you add them). All places require several fields: GPS coordinate, date visited, type (campground, hotel, restaurant, etc), name, description. In order to ensure the best quality of data these fields are REQUIRED for all submissions. The correct format for these fields are explained below.

### You've got all the data and permission, what next?

1. Put your data in the iOverlander format. See our post on the [iOverlander input format][1] for the details on what this means.
2. Email it to us!
3. Become a moderator and help remove duplicates and clean your data.
4. Recruit all your overlander friends to use iOverlander!

###  Have data, but no time?

If you have a past listing of places you'd like us to add, but you just don't have time to put it in our format. [Contact us][2] - we'll review the coordinates, and if it's high quality info we'll do our best to find some volunteers to help get everything cleaned up and sorted out.
